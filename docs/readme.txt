	o GrimQ: addded spawnSmart to implement smart spawner sets
	o GrimQ: added partyDist utility function
	o GrimQ: fixed a bug where inventory functions printed information on the console
	o GrimQ: fixed a bug where inventory functions ignored inventory slots information
	o GrimQ: fromAllEntitiesInWorld now supports extra syntax like lualinq where (see below)
	o LuaLinq: toTuple() converts a lua linq structure to a tuple
	o LuaLinq: added exceptby and intersectionby methods
	o LuaLinq: added dump to debug data interactively
	o LuaLinq: added some shortcuts for foreach and other methods with longish names
	o LuaLinq: fromSet creates a structure from a set (table where only the key matters)
	o LuaLinq: where can take multiple possible reference values, or parameters which will be passed to the predicate
	o LuaLinq: foreach now accepts a string to call a method of the object itself. Also, in both modes (string or function) it 
				accepts extra parameters which will be relayed to the method/function

	o GrimQ: Fixed (hopefully) all corner cases

	o GrimQ: directionFromPos(fromx, fromy, tox, toy) - returns a facing value given starting and end positions
	o GrimQ: directionFromDelta(dx, dy) - returns a direction given the differences in x and y (the opposite of getForward)
	o GrimQ: destroy(entity) - can be called on any item and most entities and automatically destroys the entity in the best way, without concerns about where the entity is or what the entity is
	o GrimQ: replace(entity, entityToSpawn, desiredId) - can be called on any item and most entities and automatically replace the entity with another in the best way, without concerns about where the entity is or what the entity is
	o GrimQ: find(id) - equivalent of findEntity, but works also for items in inventory or mouse cursor
	o GrimQ: gameover() - kills the party (equivalent to destroy(party))
	o GrimQ: isContainerOrAlcove(entity) - returns true if entity is either a container or an alcove/altar
